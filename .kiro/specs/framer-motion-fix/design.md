# Design Document

## Overview

The application is experiencing a runtime error due to Framer Motion's limitation with spring animations that use more than two keyframes. The specific issue is located in `components/hero-logo-animation.tsx` where a spring animation attempts to animate the `y` property with three keyframes: `[0, -10, 0]`. This design document outlines the solution to fix this issue while maintaining the visual appearance and behavior of the animations.

## Architecture

The fix involves modifying the problematic animation in the HeroLogoAnimation component to use an approach compatible with Framer Motion's spring animation constraints. We have two main approaches:

1. **Change Animation Type**: Convert spring animations with multiple keyframes to use `keyframes` or `tween` animation types
2. **Split Animation**: Break complex multi-keyframe spring animations into sequential two-keyframe animations

## Components and Interfaces

### Affected Components

#### HeroLogoAnimation Component
- **Location**: `components/hero-logo-animation.tsx`
- **Issue**: Line 52 contains `y: [0, -10, 0]` with `type: "spring"`
- **Solution**: Change animation type from "spring" to "keyframes" or use sequential animations

### Animation Patterns

#### Current Problematic Pattern
```typescript
animate={{
  y: [0, -10, 0],
}}
transition={{
  type: "spring",
  // ... other spring properties
}}
```

#### Solution Pattern 1: Keyframes Animation
```typescript
animate={{
  y: [0, -10, 0],
}}
transition={{
  type: "keyframes",
  duration: 3,
  repeat: Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY,
  repeatType: "reverse",
}}
```

#### Solution Pattern 2: Sequential Spring Animations
```typescript
// Use useAnimation hook to control sequential animations
const controls = useAnimation()

useEffect(() => {
  const sequence = async () => {
    await controls.start({ y: -10, transition: { type: "spring" } })
    await controls.start({ y: 0, transition: { type: "spring" } })
  }
  sequence()
}, [])
```

## Data Models

No data model changes are required for this fix. The changes are purely related to animation configuration.

## Error Handling

### Current Error
- **Error Type**: Runtime Error
- **Message**: "Only two keyframes currently supported with spring and inertia animations"
- **Impact**: Application crashes or becomes unstable

### Error Prevention
- Implement animation validation patterns
- Use TypeScript types to prevent similar issues
- Add comments documenting animation constraints

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
1. **Component Rendering Tests**: Ensure components render without errors after fixes
2. **Animation Property Tests**: Verify animation properties are correctly configured
3. **Error Boundary Tests**: Confirm no runtime errors are thrown

### Integration Testing
1. **Page Load Tests**: Verify pages load successfully without animation errors
2. **Animation Behavior Tests**: Confirm animations maintain their visual appearance
3. **Performance Tests**: Ensure animation changes don't negatively impact performance

### Manual Testing
1. **Visual Regression Testing**: Compare before/after animation behavior
2. **Cross-browser Testing**: Verify fixes work across different browsers
3. **Device Testing**: Test on various screen sizes and devices

### Test Cases

#### Test Case 1: Hero Logo Animation
- **Given**: User visits the homepage
- **When**: The hero section loads
- **Then**: The logo animation plays smoothly without console errors

#### Test Case 2: Animation Visual Consistency
- **Given**: The animation fix is applied
- **When**: Comparing with the original animation
- **Then**: The visual behavior should be identical or improved

#### Test Case 3: No Runtime Errors
- **Given**: The application is running
- **When**: All animations are triggered
- **Then**: No Framer Motion related errors appear in the console
