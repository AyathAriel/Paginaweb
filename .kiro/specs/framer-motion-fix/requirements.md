# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical runtime error in the application where Framer Motion animations are failing due to spring animations attempting to use more than two keyframes. The error occurs when trying to animate with values `0,-10,0`, but Framer Motion's spring and inertia animations currently only support two keyframes. This fix will ensure all animations work properly and the application runs without runtime errors.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the website to load and display animations without runtime errors, so that I can have a smooth browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display all animations without throwing runtime errors
2. WHEN spring animations are triggered THEN the system SHALL use only two keyframes maximum
3. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL not display any Framer Motion related error messages in the console

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify and fix all problematic Framer Motion animations, so that the application is stable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing animation code THEN the system SHALL identify all instances of spring animations with more than two keyframes
2. WHEN fixing animations THEN the system SHALL maintain the visual appearance and behavior of the original animations
3. WHEN animations are updated THEN the system SHALL use appropriate Framer Motion animation types that support the desired keyframe sequences

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to prevent future similar issues, so that the application remains stable as new animations are added.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new animations THEN the system SHALL use animation patterns that are compatible with Framer Motion constraints
2. WHEN using spring animations THEN the system SHALL limit keyframes to two values maximum
3. WHEN complex animations are needed THEN the system SHALL use alternative animation approaches like keyframes or transition animations
