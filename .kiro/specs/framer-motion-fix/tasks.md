# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix the problematic spring animation in HeroLogoAnimation component
  - Modify the animation in `components/hero-logo-animation.tsx` line 52 to use keyframes instead of spring type
  - Change the transition type from "spring" to "keyframes" for the y-axis animation
  - Maintain the same visual behavior and timing
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Scan and identify other potential spring animation issues
  - Search through all component files for similar spring animation patterns with multiple keyframes
  - Create a list of any other problematic animations that need fixing
  - Document findings for future reference
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 3.1_

- [ ] 3. Test the animation fix
  - Create a simple test to verify the component renders without errors
  - Manually test the animation behavior to ensure visual consistency
  - Verify no console errors appear when the animation runs
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

- [ ] 4. Add animation pattern documentation
  - Add code comments explaining the keyframes vs spring animation choice
  - Document the Framer Motion constraint for future developers
  - Include examples of correct animation patterns
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2_
